  <h1>About me</h1>

  <p>Software designer and developer engineer for twenty years in large companies, with a focus this last decade on JVM
    (Java, Spring, Kotlin, Scala) and Web (Angular) technologies.</p>

  <p>The spirit of the craftsman animates my daily work, quality is not an option, and technical excellence matters.</p>

  <p>Since the beginning of my career, I have advocated the development of well-designed software as a medium and
    long-term investment to combine human and economic benefits by improving the developer’s experience and the
    company’s responsiveness to the market.</p>

  <p>Collaborative work with domain experts, Event-storming, Specification by example, Domain-Driven Design, Test-Driven
    Development, SOLID principles, Design patterns, OO and Functional paradigms, Clean, Reactive, distributed
    architectures, the Actor model, are ingredients I like to use in order to tackle domain complexity, delight elegant
    code writing, and apprehend the non-functional aspects of demanding systems.</p>

  <p>Coaching, presenting, and drawing activities allow me to satisfy my natural need to transmit knowledge and thus to
    contribute to the development of IT teams’ skills.</p>
